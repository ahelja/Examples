// This shows a simple example of how to draw text in a window using
// ATSUI. This may look like a lot of code just to draw one string,
// but the benefit of doing all this set up in ATSUI is that it takes
// very little additional code to do something much fancier. The
// other examples will make this more clear.
//
// The concept of setting a "triple" of tag, size, value when passing
// settings to ATSUI for styles and layouts is demonstrated here. This is
// a core concept of ATSUI. Nearly everything that is passed to ATSUI is
// done so as a triple. Note that even for very small objects, such as
// CGContextRefs, you still always pass a pointer to it in the "value"
// parameter, not the acutal value.
//
// The minimal case to draw in ATSUI is to create a layout and a style,
// then call ATSUIDrawText on the layout. The acutal string to be drawn
// is stored in an array of UniChar type (UTF-16) that is owned by you,
// the caller. ATSUI merely keeps a pointer to this array. The caller is
// responsible for the storage of the text buffer.
//
// Layouts and styles are meant to be persistent. Keep them around until
// you are completely done with them. It is much quicker to keep the
// layouts around and redraw them than to set everything up from scratch.

	// Create a style object. This is one of two objects necessary to draw using ATSUI.
	// (The layout is the other.)
	verify_noerr( ATSUCreateStyle(&style) );

	// Now we are going to set a few things in the style.
	// This is not strictly necessary, as the style comes
	// with some sane defaults after being created, but
	// it is useful to demonstrate.
	
    // Look up the font we are going to use, and set it in the style object, using
	// the aforementioned "triple" (tag, size, value) semantics. This is how almost
	// all settings in ATSUI are applied.

    tags[0] = kATSUFontTag;

	// Notice below the point size is set as Fixed, not an int or a float.
	// For historical reasons, most values in ATSUI are Fixed or Fract, not int or float.
	// See the header FixMath.h in the CarbonCore framework for conversion macros.

    // Set the point size, also using a triple. You can actually set multiple triples at once,
	// since the tag, size, and value parameters are arrays. Other examples do this, such as
	// the vertical text example.
	//

	tags[0] = kATSUSizeTag;
    sizes[0] = sizeof(Fixed);
    values[0] = &pointSize;
    verify_noerr( ATSUSetAttributes(style, 1, tags, sizes, values) );
	
	// Now we create the second of two objects necessary to draw text using ATSUI, the layout.
	// You can specify a pointer to the text buffer at layout creation time, or later using
	// the routine ATSUSetTextPointerLocation(). Below, we do it after layout creation time.
	verify_noerr( ATSUCreateTextLayout(&layout) );

	// Before assigning text to the layout, we must first convert the string we plan to draw
	// from a CFStringRef into an array of UniChar.
	string = CFStringCreateWithCString(NULL, "Hello World!", kCFStringEncodingASCII);

    // Extract the raw Unicode from the CFString, then dispose of the CFString
    length = CFStringGetLength(string);
    text = (UniChar *)malloc(length * sizeof(UniChar));
    CFStringGetCharacters(string, CFRangeMake(0, length), text);
	CFRelease(string);

    // Attach the resulting UTF-16 Unicode text to the layout
    verify_noerr( ATSUSetTextPointerLocation(layout, text, kATSUFromTextBeginning, kATSUToTextEnd, length) );
	
	// Now we tie the two necessary objects, the layout and the style, together
	verify_noerr( ATSUSetRunStyle(layout, style, kATSUFromTextBeginning, kATSUToTextEnd) );

	// Before we draw, there is one last thing we must do. Set up a CGContext.
	//
	// On OS 9, ATSUI would draw using only Quickdraw. With Mac OS X, it can draw with
	// either Quickdraw or CoreGraphics. Quickdraw is now being de-emphasized in favor
	// of CoreGraphics, to the point where ATSUI will default to drawing using CoreGraphics.
	// By default ATSUI will work by using the cannonical CGContext that comes with every GrafPort.
	// However, it is preferred that clients set up their own CGContext and pass it to ATSUI
	// before drawing. This not only gives the client more control, it offers the best performance.
	//
	QDBeginCGContext(port, &cgContext);
	tags[0] = kATSUCGContextTag;
	sizes[0] = sizeof(CGContextRef);
	values[0] = &cgContext;
	verify_noerr( ATSUSetLayoutControls(layout, 1, tags, sizes, values) );
	
	// Now, finally, we are ready to draw.
	//
	// When drawing it is important to note the difference between QD and CG style coordinates.
	// For QD, the y coordinate starts at zero at the top of the window, and goes down. For CG,
	// it is just the opposite. Because we have set a CGContext in our layout, ATSUI will be
	// expecting CG style coordinates. Otherwise, it would be expecting QD style coordinates.
	// Also, remember ATSUI only accepts coordinates in Fixed, not float or int. In our example,
	// "x" and "y" are the coordinates in QD space. "cgY" contains the y coordinate in CG space.
	//
	x = kHelloWorldMargin; // leave a small left margin
	y = (portBounds.bottom - portBounds.top) / 2.0; // Center the text vertically
	cgY = (portBounds.bottom - portBounds.top) - y; // Subtract the y coordinate from the height of the
													// window to get the coordinate in CG-aware space.

	verify_noerr( ATSUDrawText(layout, kATSUFromTextBeginning, kATSUToTextEnd, X2Fix(x), X2Fix(cgY)) );
	
	// This is a one-shot window, so we are now ready to dispose of all our objects.
	// Normally, we would want to keep everything around in case we needed to redraw or change
	// the text at some point.
	
    // Tear down the CGContext
	CGContextFlush(cgContext);
	QDEndCGContext(port, &cgContext);

	// Deallocate string storage
	free(text);

	// Layout and style also need to be disposed
	verify_noerr( ATSUDisposeStyle(style) );

    // Restore the graphics port

SimpleExample is the "Hello, world" of the Swing release.  It brings up
a window displaying a regular button followed by three radio buttons.
The regular button does nothing; it's there for looks alone.  The other
three buttons let you choose the look and feel (L&F) that SimpleExample
uses.

To run the SimpleExample demo:

  java -jar SimpleExample.jar

These instructions assume that the 1.4 version of the java
command is in your path.  If it isn't, then you should either
specify the complete path to the java command or update your
PATH environment variable as described in the installation
instructions for the Java 2 SDK.

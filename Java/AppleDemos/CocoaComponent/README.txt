Cocoa Component Tutorial for Mac OS X J2SE 1.4.1
Copyright (c) 2003 Apple Computer. All rights reserved.
Version 0.1

Enclosed you will find a sample AWT application which demonstrates how to integrate an NSView into the AWT component hierarchy.  The directory 'NSMovieSample' contains a Project Builder project to build this sample (J2SE 1.4.1 DP9 is required).  The directory 'api' includes the HTML documentation for the entire Extended AWT package, included the CocoaComponent which is relevant to this sample.

See the tutorial's source files 'sample.m' and 'NSMovieView.java' as well as the enclosed documentation for instructions and pointers on how to integrate your own NSViews into AWT.  This particular sample demonstrates how to play movies, aif files, and mp3s within Java.  The control is editable, so by left-mouse-shift clicking and dragging on the control you can highlight sections of the media to cut, copy, and paste.  Simply make a selection, right click on the control to get a popup, select copy, change selections, right click, and select paste to copy one section to another.  Apple technology is a wonderful thing!

To run the enclosed sample, install J2SE 1.4.1 DP, make 1.4.1 your default as opposed to 1.3.1, build the sample, and then run it.

Have Fun!!!

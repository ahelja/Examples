@implementation CircleView

// Many of the methods here are similar to those in the simpler DotView example.
// See that example for detailed explanations; here we will discuss those
// features that are unique to CircleView. 

// CircleView draws text around a circle, using Cocoa's text system for
// glyph generation and layout, then calculating the positions of glyphs
// based on that layout, and using NSLayoutManager for drawing.

    angularVelocity = M_PI_2;

    // basic non-view components of the text system:
    // an NSTextStorage, an NSLayoutManager, and an NSTextContainer.

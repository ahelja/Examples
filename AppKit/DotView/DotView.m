@implementation DotView

// initWithFrame: is NSView's designated initializer (meaning it should be
// overridden in the subclassers if needed, and it should call super, that is
// NSView's implementation).  In DotView we do just that, and also set the
// instance variables.
//
// Note that we initialize the instance variables here in the same way they are
// initialized in the nib file. This is adequate, but a better solution is to make
// sure the two places are initialized from the same place. Slightly more
// sophisticated apps which load nibs for each document or window would initialize
// UI elements at the time they're loaded from values in the program.

- (id)initWithFrame:(NSRect)frame {
    [super initWithFrame:frame];
    center.x = 50.0;
    center.y = 50.0;
    radius = 10.0;
    color = [[NSColor redColor] retain];
    return self;
}

// dealloc is the method called when objects are being freed. (Note that "release"
// is called to release objects; when the number of release calls reduce the
// total reference count on an object to zero, dealloc is called to free
// the object.  dealloc should free any memory allocated by the subclass
// and then call super to get the superclass to do additional cleanup.

- (void)dealloc {
    [color release];
    [super dealloc];
}

// drawRect: should be overridden in subclassers of NSView to do necessary
// drawing in order to recreate the the look of the view. It will be called
// to draw the whole view or parts of it (pay attention the rect argument);
// it will also be called during printing if your app is set up to print.
// In DotView we first clear the view to white, then draw the dot at its
// current location and size.

- (void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect {
    NSRect dotRect;

    [[NSColor whiteColor] set];
    NSRectFill([self bounds]);   // Equiv to [[NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:[self bounds]] fill]

    dotRect.origin.x = center.x - radius;
    dotRect.origin.y = center.y - radius;
    dotRect.size.width  = 2 * radius;
    dotRect.size.height = 2 * radius;
    
    [color set];
    [[NSBezierPath bezierPathWithOvalInRect:dotRect] fill];
}

// Views which totally redraw their whole bounds without needing any of the
// views behind it should override isOpaque to return YES. This is a performance
// optimization hint for the display subsystem. This applies to DotView, whose
// drawRect: does fill the whole rect its given with a solid, opaque color.

- (BOOL)isOpaque {
    return YES;
}

// Recommended way to handle events is to override NSResponder (superclass
// of NSView) methods in the NSView subclass. One such method is mouseUp:.
// These methods get the event as the argument. The event has the mouse
// location in window coordinates; use convertPoint:fromView: (with "nil"
// as the view argument) to convert this point to local view coordinates.
//
// Note that once we get the new center, we call setNeedsDisplay:YES to 
// mark that the view needs to be redisplayed (which is done automatically
// by the AppKit).

- (void)mouseUp:(NSEvent *)event {
    NSPoint eventLocation = [event locationInWindow];
    center = [self convertPoint:eventLocation fromView:nil];
    [self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
}

// setRadius: is an action method which lets you change the radius of the dot.
// We assume the sender is a control capable of returning a floating point
// number; so we ask for it's value, and mark the view as needing to be 
// redisplayed. A possible optimization is to check to see if the old and
// new value is the same, and not do anything if so.

- (void)setRadius:(id)sender {
    radius = [sender floatValue];
    [self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
}

// setColor: is an action method which lets you change the color of the dot.
// We assume the sender is a control capable of returning a color (NSColorWell
// can do this). We get the value, release the previous color, and mark the
// view as needing to be redisplayed. A possible optimization is to check to
// see if the old and new value is the same, and not do anything if so.
 
- (void)setColor:(id)sender {
    [color autorelease];
    color = [[sender color] retain];

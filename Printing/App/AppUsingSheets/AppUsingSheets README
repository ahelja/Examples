This is a simple document based application that uses sheets during 
printing. It properly handles the availability of sheets on Mac OS X 
and the fact that sheets are not implemented on Mac OS 8/9. The sample 
print loop code is modern and uses the Printing "Session" Based API.

Extra features include:
a) Print One Copy handling (printing without the Print dialog)
b) Demonstration of Save As PDF functionality without using the printing 
dialogs. The routines used to perform this are only available on 
Mac OS X v10.1 and later and are NOT available in CarbonLib. The code
can conditionally be built as CFM and if so, the needed routines are 
looked up at runtime and, when executing on Mac OS X v10.1 and later, 
are looked up dynamically and called when appropriate.

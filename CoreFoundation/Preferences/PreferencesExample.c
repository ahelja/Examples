    // for an app to read/write preferences that are per user and per app; they will apply on all 
    // machines (on which this user can log in, of course --- for users who are local to a machine,
    // the preferences will end up being restricted to that host). These functions also do a search 
    // through the various cases; if a preference has been set in a less-specific domain (for 
    // instance, "all apps"), its value will be retrieved with this call. This allows globally 
    // setting some preference values (which makes more sense for some preferences than others).

    // CFArray, CFDictionary, CFNumber, CFBoolean, CFData, and CFString.
    // This example just shows CFNumber.

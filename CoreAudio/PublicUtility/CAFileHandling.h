// Creates a Tree from Library/Audio/
// Each contained tree's context.info is a CFURLRef - The client should NOT release this URL
// The Returned Trees are owned by the objects
// if you save a file in one of the trees, it is added to the tree for you

// The Root of the tree handed back contains the parent dir from which all of the tree is built

// A CAFileHandling subclass is designed to deal with files of a particular type
// Thus, the IsItem call will return true if Tree node matches the described files

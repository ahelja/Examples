<H1>AudioHardware</H1><hr>
The audio HAL provides an abstraction through which applications can access audio hardware. To
do this, the HAL provides a small set of AudioObjects that provide access to the various pieces
of the system.
<br><br>
AudioObjects all have a set of properties that describe and manipulate their state. A property
is accessed via an ordered triple. The first ordinate is the selector which describes the
property. The other two ordinates are the scope and element that identify the particular part of
the object in which to look for the selector. The AudioObjectPropertyAddress structure
encapsulates the property address. The value of a property is an untyped block of data whose
content depends on the specifics of the selector. Some selectors also require the use of a
qualifier when querying. The qualifier allows for additional information to be provided to be
used in the manipulation of the property. Changing the value of a property is always considered
asynchronous.
<br><br>
Applications use the routines AudioObjectHasProperty(), AudioObjectIsPropertySettable() and
AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() to find useful meta-information about the property. Apps use
AudioObjectGetPropertyData() and AudioObjectSetPropertyData() to manipulate the value of the
property. Apps use AudioObjectAddPropertyListener() and AudioObjectRemovePropertyListener() to
register/unregister a function that is to be called when a given property's value changes.
<br><br>
The class of an AudioObject determines the basic functionality of the object in terms of what
functions will operate on it as well as the set of properties that can be expected to be
implemented by the object. The set of available classes for objects is limited to those defined
here. There are no other classes. The set of classes is arranged in a hierarchy such that one
class inherits the properties/routines of it's super class.
<br><br>
The base class for all AudioObjects is the class AudioObject. As such, each AudioObject will 
provide basic properties such as it's class, it's human readable name, and the other
AudioObjects it contains. Other important classes include AudioSystemObject, AudioDevice, and
AudioStream.
<br><br>
The AudioObjects in the HAL are arranged in a containment hierarchy. The root of the hierarchy
is the one and only instance of the AudioSystemObject class. The properties of the
AudioSystemObject describe the process global settings such as the various default devices and
the notification run loop. The AudioSystemObject also contains all the AudioDevices that are
available.
<br><br>
Instances of the AudioDevice class encapsulate individual audio devices. An AudioDevice serves
as the basic unit of IO. It provides a single IO cycle, a timing source based on it, and all the
buffers synchronized to it. The IO cycle presents all the synchronized buffers to the client in
the same call out along with time stamps that specify the current time, when the input data was
acquired and when the output data will be presented.
<br><br>
AudioDevices contain instances of the AudioStream class. An AudioStream represents a single
buffer of data for transferring across the user/kernel boundary. As such, AudioStreams are the
gatekeepers of format information. Each has it's own format and list of available formats.
AudioStreams can provide data in any format, including encoded formats and non-audio formats. If
the format is a linear PCM format, the data will always be presented as 32 bit, native endian
floating point. All conversions to and from the true physical format of the hardware is handled
by the device's driver.
<br><br>
Both AudioDevices and AudioStreams can contain instances of the AudioControl class or it's many
subclasses. An AudioControl provides properties that describe/manipulate a particular aspect of
the object such as gain, mute, data source selection, etc. Many common controls are also
also available as properties on the AudioDevice or AudioStream.

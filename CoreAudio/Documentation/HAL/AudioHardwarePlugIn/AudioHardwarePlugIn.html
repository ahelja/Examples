<H1>AudioHardwarePlugIn</H1><hr>
This is the CFPlugIn interface presented by a HAL plug-in. The HAL will create only one instance
of each interface. This instance is responsible for providing all required services on behalf of
as many devices of the kind it implements.
<br><br>
The Initialize method is called to allow the plug-in to set itself up. At this time any devices
of it's kind and their streams can be presented to the system using
AudioHardwareDevicesCreated() and AudioHardwareStreamsCreated(). The plug-in is also responsible
for managing it's own notifications, and may install any CFRunLoopSources it needs using
AudioHardwareAddRunLoopSource() at this time as well.
<br><br>
Teardown() is called when the HAL is unloading itself and the plug-in should dispose of any
devices and streams it has created using AudioHardwareDevicesDied() and
AudioHardareStreamsDied().
<br><br>
The rest of the methods in this interface correspond to the semantics of their similarly named
counterparts in <CoreAudio/AudioHardware.h>. The HAL basically passes these calls directly to
the plug-in in this fashion.
<br><br>
Plug-ins do not have to manage device or stream property listener procs. Instead, a plug-in can
call AudioHardwareDevicePropertyChanged() or AudioHardwareStreamPropertyChanged() and the HAL
will take care of calling all the appropriate listeners.

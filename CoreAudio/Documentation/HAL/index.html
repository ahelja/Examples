		<dd><dt>IOAudio family drivers can specify a CFBundle in order to implement device specific properties on behalf of the HAL. The CFBundle provides routines for opening and closing the device as well as the property management routines. The mechanism by which the driver specifies which CFBundle to load is defined by the IOAudio driver family in IOKit. The routines described in this header are loaded by name from the CFBundle.

		<dd><dt>The audio HAL provides an abstraction through which applications can access audio hardware. To do this, the HAL provides a small set of AudioObjects that provide access to the various pieces of the system.

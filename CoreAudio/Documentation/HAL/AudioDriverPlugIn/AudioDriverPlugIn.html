<H1>AudioDriverPlugIn</H1><hr>
IOAudio family drivers can specify a CFBundle in order to implement device specific properties
on behalf of the HAL. The CFBundle provides routines for opening and closing the device as well
as the property management routines. The mechanism by which the driver specifies which CFBundle
to load is defined by the IOAudio driver family in IOKit. The routines described in this header
are loaded by name from the CFBundle.

<p>	Music Device Components are Audio Units - they implement
all of the standard selectors as described in previous sections of this
document. Its additional APIs are designed around the concept of the
creation of notes, where notes ultimately generate audio data in response to
some control protocol. Essentially the tasks required to do software based
synthesizers, virtual instruments, and so forth.</p>

<h2>The MusicDevice and MIDI</h2>

<p>	MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was designed as a protocol to
allow the communication of data to control synthesizers, particularly from a
performance perspective. It has been very successful and widely adopted since
its introduction in the early 1980's. The MIDI specification is now
multi-faceted, with various standards that apply to a wide variety of situations
and uses. In its inception, MIDI contained two primary features, the
specification of a transport layer (baud rate, type of plug and cable, etc) and
a protocol for how these bits would be transmitted and recognised by the
receiver.</p>

<p>	There are many references and notes about MIDI freely available, so we
will assume that you understand how MIDI works for the basis of this
discussion.</p>

<p>	Music Device components have two functions that provide a MIDI-based protocol interface.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDeviceMIDIEvent"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDeviceMIDIEvent">MusicDeviceMIDIEvent</a></h3>
Send a MIDI event to a Music Device.
<pre>ComponentResult <b>MusicDeviceMIDIEvent</b>(
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceComponent">MusicDeviceComponent</a>  ci,
  UInt32                inStatus,
  UInt32                inData1,
  UInt32                inData2,
  UInt32                inOffsetSampleFrame
);</pre>
	
		This function is used for any of the MIDI Channel events:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Note Off</li>
			<li>Note On</li>
			<li>Poly Pressure</li>
			<li>Control Change</li>
			<li>Program Change</li>
			<li>Channel Pressure</li>
			<li>Pitch Bend</li>
		</ul>
	
		This event should be a complete MIDI event, i.e. no assumption of
		running status should be made.
	<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl><dt><tt>ci</tt></dt>
<dd>
			The Music Device to receive the event.
		</dd>
<dt><tt>inStatus</tt></dt>
<dd>

<dt><tt>inData1</tt></dt>
<dd>
			The MIDI message's first data byte (if any).
		</dd>
<dt><tt>inData2</tt></dt>
<dd>
			The MIDI message's second data byte (if any).
		</dd>
<dt><tt>inOffsetSampleFrame</tt></dt>
<dd>
			If non-zero, specifies that the event should be rendered at this
			sample frame offset within the next buffer to be rendered.
			Otherwise, the event will occur at the beginning of the next buffer.
		</dd>
</dl>




<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDeviceSysEx"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDeviceSysEx">MusicDeviceSysEx</a></h3>

);</pre>
	
	<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl><dt><tt>ci</tt></dt>
<dd>
			The Music Device to receive the event.
		</dd>
<dt><tt>inData</tt></dt>

<a name="TheExtendedControlProtocoloftheMusicDevice"></a>
<h2>The Extended Control Protocol of the MusicDevice</h2>

<p> 	The MIDI protocol for starting and controlling notes is based
around channels. The NoteOn event starts a note on the specified channel,
then the various control events are by and large, addressed to channel
numbers. When stopping a note, both the channel and the note number are
specified. MIDI also contains the concept of instruments, where in normal
usage one instrument is active per channel (defined through the channels'
bank and program change number). Some hardware synthesizers work around
this limitation by defining performances where a channel may have different
instruments assigned to different key ranges within the same channel.</p>

<p>	There are a number of limitations to MIDI that need not apply to a
software based system. The resolution of MIDI messages is often less than is
desirable. Control messages are directed solely at a particular channel; the
finer grained controls of instruments sharing a channel number is lost.  For a
software based synthesizer there is no discrimination between the act of making
an instrument active on a particular channel and preparing the instrument for
being used at a later stage. There are insufficient channels within a single
MIDI stream to control complex scores.</p>

<p>	Music Device Components provide an extended protocol for dealing with
music instruments. This protocol is intended to address the shortcomings of
MIDI, whilst retaining a compatibility mode (i.e. the MIDI protocol can be
represented completely within this extended protocol, without inheriting its
limitations). It is intended that any component that implements the MusicDevice
API can do so by just implementing these extended API, and the MIDI messages can
be translated to those API internally. As the MIDI messages fit within the
extended protocol, a host can use either set of methods interchangeably to
address the MusicDevice, and there should be no inconsistency as a result of
that, provided of course that the host is using the extended API within the
restrictions of the MIDI protocol.</p>

<p>	Firstly, the extended protocol is note based. A note is started, and when
started it is assigned both an InstrumentID that the note should be played on as
well as the GroupID that this particular note should belong to. Control messages
are sent to a group, as in MIDI, but because notes are assigned to their
instrument when they are begun, there is no strong corelation between an
instrument and a group as there is in MIDI. The GroupID that a note is assigned
to is an arbitrary value. For maximum flexibility each note can be assigned its
own GroupID, or to control a group of notes with single commands, a collection
of notes can all be assigned to the same GroupID. A note is finished in one of
two ways - the individual note can be stopped, or all of the notes belonging to
a particular group can be stopped with a single command to that GroupID.</p>

<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDevicePrepareInstrument"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDevicePrepareInstrument">MusicDevicePrepareInstrument</a></h3>
Load an instrument.
<pre>ComponentResult <b>MusicDevicePrepareInstrument</b>(
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceComponent">MusicDeviceComponent</a>     ci,
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceInstrumentID">MusicDeviceInstrumentID</a>  inInstrument
);</pre>
	
		Used to prepare an instrument without explicitly setting the instrument for
		a specific channel/group. The InstrumentID that is passed in to
		PrepareInstrument can be encoded in a manner that allows instruments to be
		read from MIDI based sample collections (which both DLS and SoundFont
		formats are). In that case, the ID is formatted as:
	
		<code>0xMMLLPP</code>
		<ul>
			<li><code>MM</code> is the MSB of a bank select control change message
			(range 0->127 when shifted down)</li>
			<li><code>LL</code> is the LSB of a bank select control change message
			(range 0->127 when shifted down)</li>
			<li><code>PP</code> is the 0-127 value of a program change message</li>
		</ul>
		This allows MusicDevice to prepare the instrument for play (loading any
		required resources, for example, sample data from disk) without making
		this instrument active on a particular group, etc.<p>

	



<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDeviceReleaseInstrument"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDeviceReleaseInstrument">MusicDeviceReleaseInstrument</a></h3>
Release an instrument's resources.
<pre>ComponentResult <b>MusicDeviceReleaseInstrument</b>(
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceComponent">MusicDeviceComponent</a>     ci,
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceInstrumentID">MusicDeviceInstrumentID</a>  inInstrument
);</pre>
	
		This call tells the MusicDevice to release any resources associated with
		the specified instrument.
	




<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDeviceStartNote"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDeviceStartNote">MusicDeviceStartNote</a></h3>
Start a note, using the extended control protocol.
<pre>ComponentResult <b>MusicDeviceStartNote</b>(
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceComponent">MusicDeviceComponent</a>           ci,
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceInstrumentID">MusicDeviceInstrumentID</a>        inInstrument,
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceGroupID">MusicDeviceGroupID</a>             inGroupID,
  <a href="au_music.html#NoteInstanceID">NoteInstanceID</a> *               outNoteInstanceID,
  UInt32                         inOffsetSampleFrame,
  const <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceNoteParams">MusicDeviceNoteParams</a> *  inParams
);</pre>
	
   StartNote returns a <a href="au_music.html#NoteInstanceID"><tt>NoteInstanceID</tt></a> that is used to stop a note. The group
   that is specified when a note is started is the groupID that is used in the
   <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitSetParameter"><tt>AudioUnitSetParameter</tt></a> call to control the notes on that group. Because you
   can specifiy the InstrumentID as well when you start a note, it is possible
   to start notes on different instruments but in the same group, allowing a
   single parameter value to alter notes on different instruments but on the
   same groups.<p>

	The returned <a href="au_music.html#NoteInstanceID"><tt>NoteInstanceID</tt></a> will follow the following convention. If the
supplied note number (which is by convention the first value that is passed in
in the <code>inParams</code> struct is an integral number, then the returned
noteID will be that integer. If the note number is a floating point number, then
a randomly created uniqueID will be returned. Thus, if you're using this function
with integral note numbers, then that same note number can be used to turn the
note off on that group. Because of this the <code>outNoteInstanceID</code>
parameter can be NULL.<p>

	The <code>inParams</code> is a variable length struct. By convention, a
two value struct will have the same semantic as MIDI, with the first value being
equivalent to a MIDI note number, and the second velocity. Because the struct
allows floating point numbers, the note can specify a fraction pitch, for
instance, 60.5 would indicate note number 60 (in MIDI terms) with a quarter
semitone added (in a twelve tone scale).<p>

	However, this is by convention and is not required. The start note params
can correspond to any number of parameters (and any range of values for those
parameters) based on the synthesizer that is being used.
	



<a name="//apple_ref/c/func/MusicDeviceStopNote"></a>
<h3><a name="MusicDeviceStopNote">MusicDeviceStopNote</a></h3>
Stop a note, using the extended control protocol.
<pre>ComponentResult <b>MusicDeviceStopNote</b>(
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceComponent">MusicDeviceComponent</a>  ci,
  <a href="au_music.html#MusicDeviceGroupID">MusicDeviceGroupID</a>    inGroupID,
  <a href="au_music.html#NoteInstanceID">NoteInstanceID</a>        inNoteInstanceID,
  UInt32                inOffsetSampleFrame
);</pre>
	
		This calls stops the specified note that is currently playing on that group
		at the specified sample offest into the next render call of the MusicDevice
		component.

<a name="MusicDeviceParameters"></a>
<h2>Music Device Parameters</h2>

<p>	Parameters are discussed in some detail in the section on <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitParameters">Audio Unit
Parameters</a>. However, it is worthwhile to reiterate some of that here.
	<pre>
	    ComponentResult <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitSetParameter">AudioUnitSetParameter</a> (<a href="au_components.html#AudioUnit">AudioUnit</a>              ci,
	                                           <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitParameterID">AudioUnitParameterID</a>   inID,
	                                           <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">AudioUnitScope</a>         inScope,
	                                           <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitElement">AudioUnitElement</a>       inElement,
	                                           Float32                inValue,
	                                           UInt32                 inBufferOffsetInFrames);</pre>
	When used with a MusicDevice component, this call (and the others for
	parameter values) can be used in two ways. Firstly, it is used in the same
	way as with other Audio Units and their parameters. For instance, Apple's
	DLSMusicDevice publishes two parameters (tuning and volume) in 10.2 in the
	same manner as other Audio Units; these are published in the global scope
	with their parameter value type, range of values, etc.</p>

<p>	Secondly, these calls can be used by specifying the
<code><a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">kAudioUnitScope_Group</a></code> for the scope. In this usage, the ID's in the
range of 0-127 will correspond with the standard attribution of MIDI controls,
e.g. 1 is modulation wheel, 7 is volume, 9 is pan, 123 is All Notes Off, etc. For
those MIDI controls that have their own command status (pitch bend, channel
pressure), those values are used with the channel set to zero. Thus, to apply
Pitch Bend the parameterID is 0xE0, for Channel Pressure (commonly called After
Touch), the parameterID is 0xD0. The element is the group number (0-15 would map
to the 16 MIDI channels) that the control should be applied to.</p>

<p>	In this usage neither Program Change or Poly Pressure is required.
Program Change because the instrumentID is specified when the note is started
(and if a particular channel selection is required for patch and bank, then the
appropriate MIDI message can be sent, though this is redundant really if you're
using the extended API). PolyPressure, because the program can arbitrarily
assign notes to groups and instruments, and then can apply the after-touch
controller to the required groups.</p>

<p>	Thus, to turn off all notes sounding on group 12:
	<pre>
	    <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitSetParameter">AudioUnitSetParameter</a> (myMusicDevice, 
	                             kAllNotesOff, //123
	                             <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">kAudioUnitScope_Group</a>,
	                             12, // my group ID
	                             0,
	                             0 /*do this as soon as you can*/);</pre>
	Similarly, to apply PitchBend of zero to all notes sounding on channel or group 4:
	<pre>
	    //kPitchBendOffset == 8192
	    <a href="au_params.html#AudioUnitSetParameter">AudioUnitSetParameter</a> (myMusicDevice, 
	                             kPitchBend, //0xE0
	                             <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">kAudioUnitScope_Group</a>,
	                             4, // my group ID
	                             0 + kPitchBendOffset,
	                             0);</pre>
	Why 8192? PitchBend is a 14bit MIDI control message, and so (for
	compatibility) when using these MIDI equivalent control ID's, you should use
	the normal range associated with that MIDI message. (PitchBends range is 0
	to 16383 with 8192 being the zero point - you can think of this as -8192 to
	8191). The above message would look like <code>OxE3 0x00 0x40</code> in
	MIDI.</p>

<p>	There are a number of properties that Apple's DLSMusicDevice supports,
which are discussed in the section on <a href="au_properties.html#MusicDeviceProperties">Music Device Properties</a>. Of
particular interest is the property
<code><a href="au_properties.html#kMusicDeviceProperty_GroupOutputBus">kMusicDeviceProperty_GroupOutputBus</a></code>. This will separate the notes
that are rendered for different groups to different output busses of the
MusicDevice, essentially allowing for an external client to have a finer degree
of control over the mix between the different group's output. Bare in mind, that
this does not necessarily mean that each group has only one instrument sound.
For example, let us imagine we want to have 4 groups from our synthesizer, and
want them to go to 4 different busses...</p>

<p>	<pre>
		// FIRST, we need to allocate 4 output busses for our music device
	    UInt32 outBusses = 4;
	    <a href="au_property_funcs.html#AudioUnitSetProperty">AudioUnitSetProperty</a> (myMusicDevice, 
	                       <a href="au_properties.html#kAudioUnitProperty_BusCount">kAudioUnitProperty_BusCount</a>, 
	                       <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">kAudioUnitScope_Output</a>,
	                       0, 
	                       &outBusses, 
	                       sizeof (outBusses));
										
	    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
		    UInt32 theBusNumber = i;
	        <a href="au_property_funcs.html#AudioUnitSetProperty">AudioUnitSetProperty</a> (myMusicDevice, 
	                           <a href="au_properties.html#kMusicDeviceProperty_GroupOutputBus">kMusicDeviceProperty_GroupOutputBus</a>,
	                           <a href="au_state.html#AudioUnitScope">kAudioUnitScope_Group</a>,
	                           i,		//this is our groupID
	                           &theBusNumber,
	                           sizeof(theBusNumber));
	    }</pre>                       
	
	We're assigning output busses and groups here as the same number (but they
	could be different). Then, any notes that are produced on groupID == 0 will
	be output on this MusicDevice's output bus (elementID) 0.</p>

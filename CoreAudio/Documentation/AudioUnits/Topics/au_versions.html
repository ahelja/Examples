<h1>Audio Unit V1 and V2</h1>
<p>	In Mac OS X version 10.2, some revisions were made to the Audio Unit API and
implementation. These changes were made in response to developer feedback and
involved a reassessment of the rendering model that was used with the original
Audio Units as published in versions 10.0 and 10.1. Originally, multichannel audio data
presented to an Audio Unit element (bus) for processing was presented as
interleaved data. However, many developers of Audio Plugins are either
processing only mono channels, or if multichannel, where each channel's data is
separated into discrete blocks - deinterleaved.</p>

<p>	This change was fundamental enough to the rendering API, that it was
thought that a new function should be provided: <code><a href="au_render.html#AudioUnitRender">AudioUnitRender</a></code>, which
supersedes the original <code>AudioUnitRenderSlice</code>. Details of these
calls can be found in the section on <a href="au_render.html#AudioUnitRendering">Audio Unit Rendering</a>. </p>

<p>	In order to publish this change, the component descriptions for an
Audio Unit have been changed. Originally, all Audio Units were designated with a
componentType of <code>kAudioUnitComponentType</code>, where the commonality of
the Audio Unit component selectors (API) was expressed through sharing the same
component type. The subType was then used to describe the different types of
Audio Units. However, this limited the name space available to Audio Units given
that to declare and Audio Unit of a particular type required usage of both the
type and subType fields of the component description. The manufacturerID field
was re-purposed to discriminate a particular effect unit from another one.</p>

<p>	With the V2 Audio Unit, Apple has redefined the component type to several
types, that represent the various different types of Audio Units. Some of these
types will have additional component selectors (or API), and others are defined
to discriminate a broad area of usage. Details can be found in the <a href="INVALID">??Types
of Audio Units</a> section.</p>

<p>	This repurposing of the component descriptions, enables usage of the
manufacturer field as a manufacturer ID. All of Apple's V2 Audio Units will
specify <code>kAudioUnitManufacturer_Apple</code> as their manufacturer ID.
Other companies can register an ID with Apple to use to identify their company.
As with other components, Apple reserves the definition of codes that contain
all lower case characters.</p>

<p>	With 10.2, Apple is in a transition period between the V1 and V2
Audio Units. As such, that release will be the final release of Mac OS X that
will contain any new V1 Audio Units. Apple will continue to provide the V1
Audio Units in consequent releases for compatibility reasons only. All future
development by Apple will be solely within the V2 domain. It is strongly
recommended by Apple that third parties develop V2 Audio Units only - there
should not be felt that there is any requirement by Apple that those companies
support the V1 protocol. Where possible, any application that does not need to
deploy on a 10.1 system and rely on a V1 Audio Unit, should only use a V2 unit.
Finally we also recommend that hosts search for V2 Audio Units, and if found,
only feel obliged to support a V2 Audio Unit, i.e. only hosting V1 Audio Units as
a fall-back position.</p>

<p>	This will hopefully help move all of us to a single protocol in this
space, and given the scarcity of V1 Audio Units when the V2 unit was introduced
with 10.2, Apple feels that this is the  most useful and clearest path to
follow.</p>

	- The Stretcher is initially shown as the top and bottom half of a prepared
	- background image.  The "stretch" animation simply moves the bottom half downwards.
	- A "center" div is defined with a 1-pixel repeating background
	_ image, which will fill the gap created as the bottom half moves downward.
	- The fill-pattern is taken as a 1-pixel line from the center of the original
	- image.  This is an alternative approach to the Phone Book widget, which
	- uses a fixed-size bottom half that moves in and out of sight.  This model
	- allows for easier changes to the stretch distance, because the center content
	- is adaptive.  See Stretcher.css for topEdge, bottomEdge and center styles.
	-
	- Set the Height key in your widget's Info.plist to the beginning expected
	- height (i.e. in "shrunk" mode).  To create a Default image, take a screenshot
	- of the widget window (Cmd-Shift-4, Space Bar, click) in its initial state.

<!-- Dropper.wdgt / Dropper.html 
     This sample widget shows you how to handle drag and drop within a widget.
     Of value here are the four drag and drop listeners, each called on their
     specific event:
     	ondragenter
     	ondragover
     	ondrop
     	ondragleave
     Assign your own handlers to these listeners and perform necessary functions
     within them.  Look at the JavaScript file for this widget to see how to 
     obtain a files URL, which you can then load or manipulate.

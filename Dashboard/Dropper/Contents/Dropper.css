/*	Styles
 *  Style sheets allow for precise control of elements within your widget.
 *  All style information is contained within the <style> tags. If you want to
 *  utilize style information, use the class or id attributes on most any tag, and set
 *  them equal to one of your defined styles. Use the class attribute when a style 
 *  is to remain static, and id if you change the style in your scripts.  When
 *  defining the style, begin the style with a period (.) if it is to remain
 *  static, and a hash (#) if it is going to be altered programatically.

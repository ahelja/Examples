\f0\fs24 \cf0 Multi-Langage is an example AppleScript Studio application that demonstrates how to use the various programming languages supported by Project Builder. It demonstrates the following languages: Objective-C, C, C++ and Java (through the Java Bridge as well as directly). It's a very simple application from a UI standpoint. It provides a series of buttons that are labeled with each language and when clicked it uses 'call method' to call an Objective-C method defined in Multi-Langage. h. These in turn then either call a function (C) or call a method of an instantiated object of the language type.\
\
Take a look at a each of the .applescript files to see how the 'call method' is used. Then examine the "Multi-Language.h" and "Multi-Language.mm" files to see how they instantiate and call methods for objects from the other languages.\
\
This example will work with AppleScript Studio 1.0 and later.}
